## Challenges and Solutions

The start of the activity was a little rocky, but it ended up well afterwards.

## Learning Outcomes

I learned that version control helps track changes and manage branches, making collaboration safer and more organized. GUI development with Flet showed me how to build interactive applications, which becomes even more powerful when combined with teamwork on shared projects. The only challenge felt at this time would be my shortcomings as a student of this new lesson and activity.

## Future Enhancements

The Personal Information could use some more functions like complete birthdates and whether a student is a male or female.
